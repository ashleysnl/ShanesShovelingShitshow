# Pixel Art Source Notes

All art was generated during this task with a cohesive arcade pixel palette and can be edited directly from the source patterns below.

## Palette
- `#0e1f3b` outline
- `#e9f7ff` snow highlight
- `#cae8ff` snow mid
- `#8dc8f7` snow shadow
- `#ff4c6d` coat
- `#b22d4a` coat shadow
- `#ffc189` skin
- `#f6b73c` shovel
- `#d7e8ff` steel
- `#ffd742` plow body
- `#e59f00` plow dark
- `#c7d6ef` plow blade

## Runtime Sprite Sources
- Runtime sprites are generated by `src/pixelAssets.js`.
- Sprite patterns are defined as small ASCII pixel maps (`playerPattern`, `plowPattern`, `snowChunkPattern`, `sparkPattern`).
- These patterns are rendered to offscreen canvas, scaled with nearest-neighbor (`imageSmoothingEnabled=false`).

## Static SVG Assets
- `assets/logo-shanes-shoveling-adventure.svg`: title/logo card used in title screen.
- `assets/player-pixel.svg`: player reference sprite sheet.
- `assets/plow-pixel.svg`: plow reference sprite sheet.

These files are plain SVG pixel blocks for easy manual edits in any text editor.
